<h1>The Dataset</h1>
<p>This dataset<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> contains data on nutrition status and food habits collected from 1265 students in rural and urban, private and government schools in Dehradun, Uttarakhand. The questionnaire used to collect the data covered an extensive range of questions, including the participant’s family type (nuclear, joint), their daily caloric intake (classified by breakfast, lunch and dinner), their physical activity, food habits, occupation of their parents, height, and weight.</p>

<h1>What will we try to look at?</h1>
<p>The large amount of variables for each observation give us a chance to look into a lot of things, but for the purpose of this piece we will try to look at the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How many calories do students eat during the day and how does this vary with their
age?</p></li>
<li><p>As students get older, how does their intake compare against the Recommended Daily Allowance?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the midday meal plan have anything to do with caloric intake through the ages?</p></li>
<li><p>What are their nutritional categories, and how do they vary with school? <br><br></p></li>

As the boxplot above shows, students from urban and rural private schools have a better daily caloric intake than those in government schools (irrespective of area).</p>

<h2>Q.2 How does this caloric intake vary with age?</h2>
<div id="and-to-what-can-we-attribute-this-pattern" class="section level3">
<h3>And to what can we attribute this pattern?</h3>
<p>How does this vary with the various ages, for each school type? For this, it makes sense to have some standard to compare it against. For this, we will use the RDA observations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the levels of intake of essential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged by the Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright! The <code>percent_exc_def</code> observations for each participant tells us how much lesser or how much more are they consuming, compared against what is recommended for them at that age.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Editing the dataset to something more meaningful. Mainly rounding off numbers.
data$age_years &lt;- round(data$age_years)
data$age_years &lt;- as.factor(data$age_years)
data$percent_exc_def &lt;- round(data$percent_exc_def)

#New Dataframe with only these values

<br></p>
<p>As students get older, they seem to be drifting further away from their recommended daily allowances and their caloric intakes are decreasing! What could be the possible reason for this pattern?</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Interesting! We can almost see the ages at which students stop receiving midday meals in government schools. This only exacerbates the shift away from their RDAs, which you can also compare with their private school counterparts. The difference is clear, there are more students in private schools, both rural and urban, whose intake is far lesser than what it should be at their age.</p>

<h2>Q.4 What are their nutritional categories?</h2>
<div id="does-their-school-type-play-a-role-in-this" class="section level3">
<h3>Does their school-type play a role in this?</h3>
<p>To see this, first, we need to count the number of students in each category:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Count Number of Students in Each category
category &lt;- data %&gt;%
  arrange(Nutrition_cat) %&gt;% 
  group_by(Nutrition_cat, group_code) %&gt;% 
  summarise(count = n())</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see what this looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>DT::datatable(category)</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"filter":"none","data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22"],["normal","normal","normal","normal","obese","obese","obese","obese","overweight","overweight","overweight","overweight","severe underweight","severe underweight","severe underweight","severe underweight","severely obese","severely obese","underweight","underweight","underweight","underweight"],["Rural Government","Rural Private","Urban Government","Urban Private","Rural Government","Rural Private","Urban Government","Urban Private","Rural Government","Rural Private","Urban Government","Urban Private","Rural Government","Rural Private","Urban Government","Urban Private","Rural Private","Urban Private","Rural Government","Rural Private","Urban Government","Urban Private"],[218,223,259,198,2,24,2,30,7,44,12,66,19,6,7,4,3,7,71,17,40,7]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Nutrition_cat<\/th>\n      <th>group_code<\/th>\n      <th>count<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":3},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>And now let’s plot it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(category, aes(fill=Nutrition_cat, y=count, x=group_code)) + 
    geom_bar(position=&quot;stack&quot;, stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
    scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      panel.spacing = unit(2, &quot;lines&quot;),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8)) +
    labs(title= &quot;Nutritional Category by School Type&quot;)+
    xlab(&quot;School Type&quot;) +
    ylab(&quot;Number of Students&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><br>
Students in Urban Private schools are more overweight, whereas those in Rural Government schools are more underweight. This makes sense, given that the kind of school is a good indicator of the student’s socio-economic status.</p>
